== Requirements ==

* 32bit Linux distribution (for FMOD api, see below) 
* freeglut API 
* fast computer

== Utilization ==

To compile the project, just do a
        $ make
and to run it:
        $ make run
or
        $ ./lixo_war

You can change some of the settings in the lb.cfg config file.

== Sound library ==

FMOD library is included int the ./lib folder. If you want to
compile the project on a different architecture, you need
to get the correct version of fmod library for your computer/
distribution on http://www.fmod.org website. 

In this case, you may eventually want to modify the Makefile and 
remove the reference to the libfmodex.so object.
